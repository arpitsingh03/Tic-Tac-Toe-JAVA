# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

## Overview

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is designed using **Java Servlets** and **JSP**, allowing two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three matching marks (either 'X' or 'O'). The game also allows players to reset the board and start a new game at any time.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Player X and Player O alternate turns.
- **Winner Detection**: The game checks for a winner after each turn.
- **Reset Functionality**: The game can be reset at any time, clearing the board.
- **Session Management**: Game progress and player turns are stored in the session, ensuring continuity during the game.
- **Interactive UI**: Simple and elegant UI with dynamic grid updates based on player actions.

## Technologies Used

- **Java (Servlets)**: For handling the game logic and server-side operations.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: For rendering the game board dynamically.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For handling click events and user interactions.
- **Apache Tomcat**: As the web server for deploying the application.
